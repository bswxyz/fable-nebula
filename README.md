# Space / astronomy template — 95k-particle three.js galaxy

**Live demo → https://bswxyz.github.io/formwork-nebula/** · [How it was built](https://bswxyz.github.io/formwork-nebula/guide/)

> A procedural spiral galaxy of ~95,000 additive-blended points, turning slowly behind the page.

A free, MIT-licensed website template. Good for: **observatories, planetariums, sci-fi projects, data-heavy landing pages**.
The demo brand ("NEBULA DRIFT") is fictional — every word and colour is meant to be replaced with yours.

## The signature technique

- Procedural galaxy: radius → spiral branch → spin twist → power-curve scatter, coloured core-to-edge
- Additive blending makes the dense core glow with no post-processing
- Camera parallax toward the cursor; distant starfield sphere for depth

## Use this as your own site

This repo is a **template** — everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS with **relative paths**, so it
works under *any* repo name with zero configuration.

1. Click **Use this template → Create a new repository** (top of this page).
   **Name it whatever you like** — `my-site`, `portfolio`, anything.
2. In your new repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**,
   then pick `main` / `/ (root)` and save. (CLI: see below.)
3. Wait ~1 minute. Your site is live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`.

```bash
gh repo create my-site --template bswxyz/formwork-nebula --public --clone
cd my-site
gh api --method POST /repos/YOUR-USERNAME/my-site/pages \
  -f 'source[branch]=main' -f 'source[path]=/'
```

No build step, no dependencies to install — edit the files, push, done.
The only external requests are Google Fonts and (where used) pinned CDN copies of GSAP/three.js.

## Customize it

- Galaxy shape: tune `COUNT`, `BRANCHES`, `SPIN`, `RND` at the top of `main.js`
- Colours: `inside` / `outside` THREE.Color stops set the core→rim gradient
- Catalogue cards: plain HTML `.card`s with per-card `--g1/--g2` nebula swatches

The `/guide/` page documents the signature technique in depth (with code) — keep it, rewrite it,
or delete the folder entirely.

## Files

```
index.html        the page
styles.css        all styling (design tokens in :root at the top)
main.js           the signature effect + motion
guide/index.html  how-it-works write-up (optional — yours to keep or delete)
```

## Built-in quality

- Works with JS disabled or a CDN failure (content is never permanently hidden)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; keyboard focus styles throughout
- Canvas/WebGL feature-detected with graceful fallbacks; devicePixelRatio capped for performance
- Responsive at phone / tablet / desktop widths
